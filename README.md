# Dotfiles and macOS Config

This repo is designed to contain everything I need to set up a new (Mac) computer from scratch. It contains:

* Dotfiles and other commit-able configuration files
* Some light scripts to e.g. symlink those dotfiles from this repo into their appropriate places
* Markdown files with documentation for things that are less easily automatable

Maybe you'll find some of this useful.
