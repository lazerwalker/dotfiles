# App-Specific Setup

## Shell
**Change shell to zsh**
`chsh -s /bin/zsh`

Installing `.oh-my-zsh` and `.zshrc` should be sufficient to set up oh-my-zsh.

* Bashmarks (wait til I have zsh config)
* Configure visor

**Install Solarized for iTerm** 

## Set up Solarized
There's a `Solarized` folder that contains various plugins with instructions.

I typically set everything to Solarized Dark, except Terminal.app gets Solarized Light so I can tell at a glance if I'm running it instead of iTerm2.

VS Code already has Solarized installed.
